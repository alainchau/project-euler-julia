# Project Euler Problem 6
#
# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
#
#                   12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
#
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
#
#             (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
#
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
# ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
#
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
# one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
